# Journ-124

## Explanation
I picked the question "Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?" since I was curious how the general public viewed this topic. I found the dataset interesting since more than half of respondents said it wasn't rude to recline your seat on a plane. My initial thought was that the response category would be closer to 70% of all responses. My chart shows that the responses are split roughly in half between people who thought it was rude or somewhat rude and people who thought it wasn't rude to recline your seat on a plane.
